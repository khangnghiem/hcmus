# Other Resources

## Basic

Probability and Statistical Inference by Hogg, Tanis and Zimmerman
Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Wackerly
Introduction to Mathematical Statistics by Hogg and Craig

## More Complex

Introduction to Mathematical Statistics by Hogg as well. I'd think it's the more rigorous version of the book mentioned above by the same author
All of Statistics by Wasserman which seems to require a lot of prior knowledge in statistics, but I think tackles just the perfect topics for machine learning
