It analyzes ML algorithms (e.g., neural networks, reinforcement learning) and sensing modalities (vision, force sensors), emphasizing the need for time-dependent models (e.g., handling dynamic interactions). Cross-analysis reveals trends, such as growing use of multimodal sensing, and offers guidelines for future HRC research, addressing gaps like limited real-world validation and understudied social interaction aspects. |

Researchers compare human teaching strategies to a machine teaching benchmark, optimized via deep learning to predict feedbackâ€™s impact on learner states. Experiments show humans teach effectively when Q-learners use low discount rates (prioritizing short-term rewards) and high learning rates (quickly updating beliefs), but their feedback remains suboptimal versus the model. Real-time visibility into learner states slightly improves teaching efficiency. Findings highlight mismatches between human intuition and machine learning dynamics, guiding AI designs that align with natural human teaching behaviors.                                                                                           |
