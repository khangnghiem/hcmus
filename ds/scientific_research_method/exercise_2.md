## Negative and Edge Test Cases

### Negative Test Cases
1. **Blurry Images**: Test with images that are out of focus to see if the algorithm can still identify objects
2. **Low Light Conditions**: Use images taken in poor lighting to check if the algorithm can handle low visibility.
3. **Obstructed Objects**: Provide images where objects are partially hidden or obstructed to test the algorithm's ability to recognize incomplete shapes.
4. **Incorrect Labels**: Feed the algorithm images with incorrect labels to see if it can detect and correct the errors.
5. **Distorted Images**: Use images that have been stretched or compressed to test the algorithm's ability to handle
6. **Color Variations**: Provide images with unusual color schemes to see if the algorithm can still identify objects correctly.

### Edge Test Cases
1. **Extreme Angles**: Test with images taken from unusual angles to see if the algorithm can still recognize objects.
2. **High Noise Levels**: Use images with a lot of visual noise to test the robustness of the algorithm.
3. **Uncommon Objects**: Provide images of rare or unusual objects to see if the algorithm can still identify them correctly.
4. **Similar Objects**: Test with images of objects that look very similar to each other to check if the algorithm can distinguish between them.
5. **Edge Cases in Size**: Use images of objects that are either very small or very large to test the algorithm's ability to handle size variations.
6. **Background Clutter**: Provide images with busy or cluttered backgrounds to see if the algorithm can still focus on the main objects.
